Performance test
1. Load test
2. Endurance test
3. Spike test
4. stress test
5. volume


RAM: At least 16Gb RAM, 32GB recommended. Avoid using more than 50% RAM.

Why command line?
- Resource utilization better
- Faster 
- HTML report generate
- Precise error report 

=======================keep your jmx file in bin===========create a folder in bin called "report"



jmeter -n -t b20_t500.jmx -l report\b20_t500.jtl

How to extract data for reporting in jmeter
============================================
Dear, 

I’ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00. 

200 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 234 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1400.
300 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 350 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2100.
400 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 424 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2800.
500 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 443 And Total Concurrent API requested: 3500.

While executed 500 concurrent request, found  82 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.23%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 3200 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries. 



Wait for the next class, shob confusion er oboshan hobe.

Till then don't try to hit others site.

Test purpose e 5 or 10 thread is okay, but don't give more. And keep the ramp up within 10 sec.

You can also study 
1. Load testing
2. Endurance testing 
3. Spike testing 
Just the definition


And this is what I will give as an assignment, just keep this with you guyz


Just think about performance testing assignment.

Assignment kintu khub সহজ
For the test site any test site eg reqres 

1. Choose one API or multiple API 

2. Req and check the response until you see green.

3. Increase the load as long as the error rate is less than one percent. By this you did load test

4. Keep this load for 10 min under threshold which you have found in step three and by this you achieved endurance test.

5. All of a sudden increase the load beyond load and check how the system behaves and by this you did spike testing.

You can run from non GUI mode and make a report.

Choose site as you wish but make sure it is a testing site. 

My question is why do you have to wait for my / our assignment to try what you have already learned?

Why don't you guys test yourself and do some project on your own? 

Now that i have given you all some idea i hope you will keep using what you have learned and explore more. Don't stay stuck, take help from anyone you see out there but I repeat don't stay stuck.
